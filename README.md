# AwesomeSwitcher v0.3

## Caleb Webber <https://github.com/seeplusplus>

This is a fork of AwesomeSwitcher by Yannik with window previews removed.

This fork also includes a fix for the this._itemsPerRow() is not a function freezes in some newer version of Gnome.

I am not a gnome shell extension developer, this fork may not be stable on all versions of Gnome. Currrently,
it is only being tested against Gnome 3.28
